Or maybe we need to print out a report for our boss or relax with a videogame after work. To obtain the desired results we need to know how to interact with each device. We need to be able to make the device understand our requests, and then the device has to communicate the results back to us in a clear and effective way. The communication mechanisms that manufacturers put in their products are called **interfaces**. Buttons and screens are examples of common interfaces. As end users, we do not need to understand the inner workings of a device; we just need to know how to communicate with it.\n",
        "\n",
        "APIs are interfaces, with the difference that they don't necessarily help physical devices communicate with humans, but rather facilitate information transfer between software programs. Imagine how useful it would be for the insurance company to know which places the customer visits most frequently in order to offer them new services. For instance, if a customer visits a car repair often, that can mean that they are in need of auto insurance. By using the Google Maps API, location service developers can provide the consumer with a wide range of applications that can communicate with each other seamlessly to increase sales and improve customer relationship management.\n",
